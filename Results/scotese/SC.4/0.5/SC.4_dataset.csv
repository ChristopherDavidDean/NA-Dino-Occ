The Upper Two Medicine has been dated by Rogers et al. (1993) using radioisotopes at 74 Ma (10 m below top of formation), an age accepted by Eberth (1997) and Trexler (2001). The top of the Dinosaur Park Formation was given an age of 74-74.5 Ma by Eberth (1997), but of 75 Ma or older by Hamblin (1994). Eberth (2005) refined this to around 74.9 Ma.
