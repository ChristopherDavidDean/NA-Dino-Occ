The uppermost St. Mary River Formation and lowermost Willow Creek Formation are both exposed along the river in this area. Due to the strongly upthrust and faulted condition of the bedrock strata in the area and the absence of obvious outcrops of the Battle Formation and Whitemud Member marker beds in the quarry area, it has been difficult to determine the precise stratigraphic position of the specimen in relation to the contact between the St. Mary River and Willow Creek formations. Nonetheless, existing geologic maps of the area suggest that the quarry occurs within the upper 30 m of the St. Mary River Formation [9]. This stratigraphic position is supported by the presence of the angiosperm palynomorph Scollardia trapaformis (D.R. Braman, personal communication) in the host matrix of TMP 2005.055.0001. S. trapaformis is diagnostic for upper beds of both the St. Mary River Formation and the combined Carbon and Whitemud members of the Horseshoe Canyon Formation (southern and central Alberta) [10, 11]. Carbon Member strata north of Drumheller have yielded the chasmosaurine Eotriceratops xerinsularis [10: Figure 3] and are assigned an age of 67.5–68.5 mega-annum (Ma) [10–12]. Given that well-established chronostratigraphic correlations across southern Alberta equate the upper Horseshoe Canyon Formation with the upper St. Mary River Formation (see Figure 9 in [13]), the holotype likely shares this same middle Maastrichtian age.","gp_mid",NA,NA,"coordinates not computable using this model","CA","","","","bed","","","","","",NA,"","","","not reported","","lithified","","","","","","","","terrestrial indet.","","","macrofossils","","","","","",NA,"","body","","parautochthonous","snapshot","","","","","","","","","","taxonomic","surface (in situ),field collection","TMP","","","","","2005","","","terrestrial",NA,"actively mobile","ground dwelling","","herbivore","oviparous, dispersal=direct/internal,mobile","accretion,modification of parts","","hydroxyapatite","compact or dense","",NA,"St. Mary River","","","","not reported","","lithified","","","","","","","","Maastrichtian","Maastrichtian","Maastrichtian","Maastrichtian","Maastrichtian","C.

In 1997, most of the bones were surface collected; others were excavated by a field party from the NMMNH. The remainder of the specimen was excavated in 2014–2016 by another NMMNH field party. The fossils were collected on the Armendaris Ranch with permission of the landowner, Ted Turner, and the assistance of the ranch manager, Tom Wadell.","","terrestrial",NA,"actively mobile","ground dwelling","","herbivore","oviparous, dispersal=direct/internal,mobile","accretion,modification of parts","","hydroxyapatite","compact or dense","",NA,"McRae","","Hall Lake","","not reported","","","","","","","","","","Campanian","-","Campanian","Campanian, Maastrichtian","Campanian, Maastrichtian","S.
