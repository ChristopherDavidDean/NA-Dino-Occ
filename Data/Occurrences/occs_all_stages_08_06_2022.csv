The uppermost St. Mary River Formation and lowermost Willow Creek Formation are both exposed along the river in this area. Due to the strongly upthrust and faulted condition of the bedrock strata in the area and the absence of obvious outcrops of the Battle Formation and Whitemud Member marker beds in the quarry area, it has been difficult to determine the precise stratigraphic position of the specimen in relation to the contact between the St. Mary River and Willow Creek formations. Nonetheless, existing geologic maps of the area suggest that the quarry occurs within the upper 30 m of the St. Mary River Formation [9]. This stratigraphic position is supported by the presence of the angiosperm palynomorph Scollardia trapaformis (D.R. Braman, personal communication) in the host matrix of TMP 2005.055.0001. S. trapaformis is diagnostic for upper beds of both the St. Mary River Formation and the combined Carbon and Whitemud members of the Horseshoe Canyon Formation (southern and central Alberta) [10, 11]. Carbon Member strata north of Drumheller have yielded the chasmosaurine Eotriceratops xerinsularis [10: Figure 3] and are assigned an age of 67.5–68.5 mega-annum (Ma) [10–12]. Given that well-established chronostratigraphic correlations across southern Alberta equate the upper Horseshoe Canyon Formation with the upper St. Mary River Formation (see Figure 9 in [13]), the holotype likely shares this same middle Maastrichtian age.",gp_mid,,,coordinates not computable using this model,St. Mary River,,,St. Mary River,,,bed,,,,,,,,,,not reported,,lithified,,,,,,,,,not reported,,lithified,,,,,,,,terrestrial indet.,,,Maastrichtian,Maastrichtian,Maastrichtian,Maastrichtian,Maastrichtian

Clay clasts are generally greenish gray (Munsell Gley 1 6/5GY), but some are gray (Munsell Gley 1 7/N), and range in size from 2 mm to 20 mm. The clay/carbonate clast ratio is locally highly variable but is usually subequal. Clay clast bulk composition (Table S1) shows the green ones are mixed siliceous mudstone compositionally very similar to unit 3 (chlorite-kaolinite-illite = 22%, 23%, 55%), while the gray ones are slightly higher in carbonate, classifying as argillaceous siliceous mudstone with a slightly higher illite fraction (chlorite-kaolinite-illite = 16%, 10%, 74%).

In stark contrast, pneumatic and vascular pore spaces inside structurally intact robust elements like vertebral centra, are filled with both precipitated (not clasts) off-white punky pedogenic carbonate (Fig. 6A) and green mudstone (Fig. 6B). Such mud-fills readily form early in the burial history of mud-hosted bone via hydrologic vacuums created by escaping decompositional gasses (Bodzioch, 2015) and indicate that RUQ tyrannosaur material was initially buried in greenish mudstone. Analysis of clay inside a RUQ tyrannosaur centra shows it to have the same kaolinite fraction, but slightly higher chlorite and lower illite levels than either unit 3 or the unit 4 green and gray clasts (Table S1). Seemingly, the constant kaolinite fraction and elevated chlorite and illite levels link all these clays genetically, with observed variations paralleling those in modern depositional settings with heterogeneous source areas (Griffiths et al., 2019).

Paleobotanical analyses on the megaflora and pollen indicates that the Ojo Alamo Sandstone is earliest Paleocene in age and is correlated with palynostratigraphic zones P1 or P2 ( Anderson, 1959; Nichols, 2003; Williamson et al., 2008; Flynn and Peppe, in press). Recent detrital sanidine and paleomagnetic work has constrained the Naashoibito Member to the latest Maastrichtian indicating the K/Pg boundary is represented by the unconformity between the Naashoibito Member and the Ojo Alamo Sandstone (Peppe et al., 2013; Flynn et al., 2019). These data, coupled with previous sedimentological analyses, demonstrate that the Naashoibito Member is late Maastrichtian in age and the Ojo Alamo Sandstone is early Paleocene in age with an erosive unconformity, that cuts out the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary, separating the two units","""Sandstone, soft white, conglomeratic; contains brown concretions""",sandstone,"concretionary,brown,white",,conglomeratic,Y,,,,,,"""Sandstone, soft white, conglomeratic; contains brown concretions""",sandstone,"concretionary,brown,white",,conglomeratic,Y,,,,,,"""channel""",,,Maastrichtian,Maastrichtian,Maastrichtian,Maastrichtian,Maastrichtian

The Upper Two Medicine has been dated by Rogers et al. (1993) using radioisotopes at 74 Ma (10 m below top of formation), an age accepted by Eberth (1997) and Trexler (2001). The top of the Dinosaur Park Formation was given an age of 74-74.5 Ma by Eberth (1997), but of 75 Ma or older by Hamblin (1994). Eberth (2005) refined this to around 74.9 Ma.
